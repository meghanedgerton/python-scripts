Most of these were originally my homework assignments from a Computational Statistics class (Math 472) that I took in my Undergraduate years (Spring 2020) at Boise State University. Others are random side projects I've done. I figured I'd put them all here because I spent WAY too long on all of these assignments to let them just waste away on my PC hard drive!
